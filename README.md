# MapR-KNN-Spark
Implementation of Map Reduce and KNN with Spark.
Spark is a Hadoop enhancement to MapReduce. The primary difference between Spark and MapReduce is that Spark processes and retains data in memory for subsequent steps, whereas MapReduce processes data on disk. As a result, for smaller workloads, Spark's data processing speeds are up to 100x faster than MapReduce.
Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is the fundamental data structure of Spark. They are immutable Distributed collections of objects of any type. As the name suggests is a Resilient (Fault-tolerant) records of data that resides on multiple nodes.
Apache Spark is written in Scala.
